# padls

***padls*** is a **P**arallel **A**synchronous **D**igital **L**ogic **S**imulator written in Rust. It has its own circuit definition language that is parsed on the command line and then set up in an interactive graphical interface. It can be used to build anything from simple latches to complicated compound circuits with clocks and memory. It was created as a project to learn more about async Rust and low level computing.
